## actors network example

### GRAPH
## read in a graph in the `graphml' formal: xml for graphs.
## it warns about pre-specified ids, but we want this here
## (these ids match up with the castlists in movies.txt)
actnet <- read.graph("actors.graphml",format="graphml")

### TRANSACTION
## read in the table of actor ids for movies
## this is a bit complex, because the movie names
## contain all sorts of special characters.
movies <- read.table("movies.txt", sep="\t", 
	row.names=1, as.is=TRUE, comment.char="", quote="")
## it's a 1 column matrix.  treat it like a vector
movies <- drop(as.matrix(movies))
## each element is a comma-separated set of actor ids.  
## use `strsplit' to break these out
movies <- strsplit(movies,",")
## and finally, match ids to names from actnet
casts <- lapply(movies, 
	function(m) V(actnet)$name[match(m,V(actnet)$id)])
## check it
casts['True Romance']
## format as arules transaction baskets
library(arules)
casttrans <- as(casts, "transactions")


## Set up STM information
castsize <- unlist(lapply(casts, function(m) length(m)))
## see ?rep.int: we're just repeating movie names for each cast member
acti <- factor(rep.int(names(casts),times=castsize))
## actors
actj <- factor(unlist(casts), levels=V(actnet)$name)
## format as STM (if you specify without `x', its binary 0/1)
actmat <- sparseMatrix(i=as.numeric(acti),j=as.numeric(actj),
		dimnames=list(movie=levels(acti),actor=levels(actj)))

## count the number of appearences by actor
nroles <- colSums(actmat)
names(nroles) <- colnames(actmat)
sort(nroles, decreasing = TRUE)[1:20]

nroles["Bacon, Kevin"]

##[1]The actors network has an edge if the two actors were in the same
##movie. Plot the entire actors network.

###Not sure if we need to use apriori here, if so is this set up right?

##I just made a plot of the act net
V(actnet)$color <- "blue"

plot(actnet, vertex.label=NA, vertex.size=3, edge.curved=FALSE)

##[2] Plot the neighborhoods for “Bacon, Kevin” at orders 1-3.
##How does the size of the network change with order?
actor <- "Bacon, Kevin"
nei <- graph.neighborhood(actnet, 1, V(actnet)[actor])[[1]]
V(nei)[actor]$color <- "red"
V(nei)$label.color = "black"
V(nei)$label.cex = 0.65
V(nei)$frame.color = NA
plot(nei, edge.curved=FALSE)

nei2 <- graph.neighborhood(actnet, 2, V(actnet)[actor])[[1]]
V(nei2)[actor]$color <- "red"
V(nei2)$label.color = ""
V(nei2)$color <- "green"
##the following line of code does not work not sure why, works in websearch?
##tells me V(nei) not a graph object but will pull V(nei)
V(nei2)[V(nei)$name]$color <- "blue"
V(nei2)$frame.color = NA
plot(nei2, vertex.size=2, edge.curved=FALSE)

nei3 <- graph.neighborhood(actnet, 3, V(actnet)[actor])[[1]]
V(nei3)[actor]$color <- "red"
V(nei2)[actor]$vertex.size = 5
V(nei3)$label.color = "black"
V(nei3)$frame.color = NA
plot(nei2, vertex.size=3, edge.curved=FALSE)

summary(nei)
summary(nei2)
summary(nei3)

##[3] Who were the most common actors? Who were most connected?
##Pick a pair of actors and describe the shortest path between them.

abetween <- betweenness(actnet)
adegree <- degree(actnet)
which.max(abetween)

sort(adegree, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
sort(abetween, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]

abetween["Bacon, Kevin"]
adegree["Bacon, Kevin"]

##shortest path between Martin Sheen and Ron Jeremy
MtoR <- get.shortest.paths(actnet, from="Sheen, Martin", to="Jeremy, Ron")
V(actnet)$name[MtoR$vpath[[1]]]

##[4] Find pairwise actor-cast association rules with at least 0.01%
##support and 10% confidence. Describe what you find.
